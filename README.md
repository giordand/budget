# budget ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/jpsierens/budget.svg?branch=master)
> App for managing budgets

:construction: Under construction :construction:

## Run

This app uses Mongo. Download and follow the installation steps. When all is done start the mongo service with:

```
mongod
```

Then start the app on another terminal tab with:
```
npm start
```

This runs a server on ```localhost:3000```, head over there to see the app. It also runs the API on port 3001 which is how the data gets CRUD.

## Stuff you can learn here
* Mongoose and how to model data
* Making APIs with Node + Express
* React + Redux
* Redux Sagas
* Async functions (app/api dir)
* ES2015+
* Webpack
* Flowtype
* Tests with Mocha + Expect
* React native integration (coming soon)
* And hopefully a way to manage your money :)
