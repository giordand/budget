# budget ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/jpsierens/budget.svg?branch=master)
> App for managing budgets

:construction: Under construction :construction:

Testing out flow in this project, but I'm not liking this issue https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/869

## Run
```
npm start
```

This starts a server on localhost:3000, head over there to see the app. It also starts the API on port 3001 which is how the data gets saved. 

This app uses Mongo. Download and follow the installation steps. When all is done start the mongo service with:

```
mongod
```
